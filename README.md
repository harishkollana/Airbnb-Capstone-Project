# Airbnb-Capstone-Project
Explorative Data Analysis on Airbnb NYC by Harish Kollana

Okay, before going to start. Let's understand what is Airbnb?

Looks Airbnb has interesting breakdown with names likely: Air, Bed and Breakfast to become Airbnb. Wow! This San-Francisco based startup offers you someoneâ€™s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. Looks, somewhat on a same business as OYO but the former doesn't owns any property instead acts as an intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent.

Well, enough of it we understood what is the data all about and where it came from.
